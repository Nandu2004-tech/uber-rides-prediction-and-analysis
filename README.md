# uber-rides-prediction-and-analysis

# Overview
In this project, you will analyze a dataset containing Uber ride data to uncover patterns, trends, and insights that can help improve the service or provide valuable business intelligence. The focus will be on conducting thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA) and developing a predictive model using regression techniques to forecast ride duration or other relevantÂ outcomes.
# Abstract
This project uses machine learning to predict Uber ride prices, enhancing user experience and optimizing dynamic pricing strategies for Uber.

# Introduction
The goal is to develop a machine learning model to predict Uber ride prices based on factors like distance, time of day, and traffic conditions, improving fare accuracy and operational efficiency.

# Problem Statement
Develop a model to predict Uber ride fares accurately, benefiting both drivers and passengers by providing reliable cost estimates.

# Motivation
Improved Fare Estimates: Enhances transparency and trust.
Better Customer Experience: Reduces fare surprises.
Operational Efficiency: Optimizes dynamic pricing.
Revenue Management: Maximizes revenue.
Market Insights: Adjusts to consumer behavior and competition.
Scalability: Adapts to new markets.
Competitive Edge: Offers predictable fare structure.
Technological Leadership: Uses machine learning for real-world applications.
 # Key Points
Data Collection and Preprocessing: Gather and clean Uber ride data.
Feature Engineering: Identify and create relevant features.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understand data patterns and correlations.
Model Selection and Training: Choose and train appropriate models.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize model performance.
Model Evaluation: Use metrics like MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R-squared.
Model Deployment: Integrate the model into a real-time system.
# Sample Code
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.svm import SVR
from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error, mean_squared_error

data = pd.read_csv('uber_data.csv')
X = data[['distance', 'duration', 'time_of_day']]
y = data['fare']
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)

svr = SVR(kernel='rbf')
svr.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)
y_pred = svr.predict(X_test_scaled)

mae = mean_absolute_error(y_test, y_pred)
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
rmse = np.sqrt(mse)

print(f'MAE: {mae}, MSE: {mse}, RMSE: {rmse}')
